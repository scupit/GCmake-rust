# Predefined Dependency Compatibility Layer

This document explains the configuration layer which makes C/C++ libraries compatible with `gcmake-rust`,
when those projects don't use gcmake-rust.

The [gcmake-dependency-configs](https://github.com/scupit/gcmake-dependency-configs) repository
on GitHub contains all current dependency configurations for gcmake-rust.

> **TODO:** Write this section. Use working examples which already exist in the repository.
