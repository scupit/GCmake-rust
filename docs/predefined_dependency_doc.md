# Predefined Dependency Compatibility Layer

This document explains the configuration which makes other libraries compatible with `gcmake-rust`.

> **TODO:** This should be written after the compatibility layer is moved into its own repository.
> Currently, external *non-gcmake* library configuration is tied to the executable itself. The
> configurations should be developed separate from the tool, but the tool should be able to download and
> update the full set of configurations.
