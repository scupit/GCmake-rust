> **TODO:** Condense linking information here.

Show examples for

- Specifying an linking both dependency types
- Linking to pre-build script
- All link specifier formats
- Special `parent`, `super`, and `root` link specifiers
- System specifiers in the link specifier
- Linking a library built elsewhere in the project tree

Explain

- Link resolution, i.e. how targets are found relative to the "current" project context.

Also **TODO:** make a document on target selectors (used to select targets or projects in some commands).
