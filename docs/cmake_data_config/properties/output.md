> **TODO:** Document the `output` property and its sub-properties. Explain topics such as how auto-linking
> works for test project outputs, linking (especially public/private links for compiled libraries), output
> types, the dependency graph, that name collision is checked, why only one library can be created
> per "project", etc.
